		<p>There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (nylon-string guitar), 
		the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar. The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced
		by the strings's vibration, amplified by the body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber.
		The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique.
		The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country
		guitar playing in the United States.</p>

		<p>Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, use an amplifier that can electronically manipulate 
		and shape the tone. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but a solid body was eventually
		found more suitable, as it was less prone to feedback. Electric guitars have had a continuing 
		profound influence on popular culture.</p>
