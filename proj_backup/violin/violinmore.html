		<p>The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications
		occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Europe it served as the basis for stringed
		instruments used in western classical music, the viola and the violin. Violinists and 
		collectors particularly prize the instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri and 
		Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona and by Jacob 
		Stainer in Austria.</p> 
		<p>According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to
		explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed. Great numbers of instruments 
		have come from the hands of "lesser" makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced
		commercial "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, 
		and Mirecourt.</p>
