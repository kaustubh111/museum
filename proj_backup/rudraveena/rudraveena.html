        <p>The rudra veena and also called bin in North India, is a large plucked
           string instrument used in Hindustani classical music, one of the major
           types of veena played in Indian classical music.</p>
        <p>It has a long tubular body made of wood or bamboo with a length between
           54 and 62 inches. Two large, round resonators, made of dried and 
           hollowed gourds, are attached under the tube. Twenty-four brass-fitted
           raised wooden frets are fixed on the tube with the help of wax. 
           There are 4 main strings and 3 chikari strings.</p>
        <p>As Rudra is a name for the Hindu god Shiva, rudra vina literally 
           means "the veena dear to Shiva".</p>
