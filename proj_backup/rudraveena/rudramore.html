<p>The rudra veena and also called bin in North India, is a large plucked
           string instrument used in Hindustani classical music, one of the major
           types of veena played in Indian classical music.</p>
        <p>It has a long tubular body made of wood or bamboo with a length between
           54 and 62 inches. Two large, round resonators, made of dried and 
           hollowed gourds, are attached under the tube. Twenty-four brass-fitted
           raised wooden frets are fixed on the tube with the help of wax. 
           There are 4 main strings and 3 chikari strings.</p>
        <p>As Rudra is a name for the Hindu god Shiva, rudra vina literally 
           means "the veena dear to Shiva".</p>
<p>Veena Maharaj Dattatreya Rama Rao Parvatikar(1916-1990) playing RudraVeena
           Bahauddin Dagar playing rudra veena in the South Indian posture.It is 
           an ancient instrument rarely played today. The rudra veena declined in
           popularity in part due to the introduction in the early 19th century 
           of the surbahar, which allowed sitarists to more easily present the 
           alap sections of slow dhrupad-style ragas. In the 20th century, 
           Zia Mohiuddin Dagar modified and redesigned the rudra veena to use 
           bigger gourds, a thicker tube (dandi), thicker steel playing strings
           (0.45-0.47 mm) and closed javari that. This produced a soft and deep 
           sound when plucked without the use of any plectrum (mizrab).</p> 
        <p>The instrument was further modified as the shruti veena by Lalmani Misra
            to establish Bharat's Shadja Gram and obtain the 22 shrutis.</p>
