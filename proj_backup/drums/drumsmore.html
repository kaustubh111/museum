		<p>A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks</li>
			<li>A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot</li>
			<li>Two or more toms, played with sticks or brushes</li>
			<li>A hi-hat, played with the sticks, opened and closed with left foot pedal</li>
			<li>One or more cymbals, played with the sticks</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>All of these are classed as non-pitched percussion, allowing for the music to be scored using
		percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for the drum kit. If some or
		all of them are replaced by electronic drums, the scoring and most often positioning remains the 
		same, allowing a standard teaching approach. The drum kit is usually played while seated on a 
		drum stool or throne. The drum kit differs from instruments that can be used to produce pitched
		melodies or chords, even though drums are often placed musically alongside others that do, such
		as the piano or guitar. The drum kit is part of the standard rhythm section used in many types
		of popular and traditional music styles ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz. Other 
		standard instruments used in the rhythm section include the electric bass, electric guitar 
		and keyboards.</p>
