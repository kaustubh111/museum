The Pakhawaj rhythms are taught just like Tabla. The quality of the high-pitched skin is same as used in Tabla to an extent. Again, it is made of different layers like Tabla and is also tuned like the Tabla with the help of wooden wedges by placing them under the tautening straps.

The fine tuning is done on the woven outer ring, which is part of the skin. The bass skin is traditionally prepared for playing by freshly applying batter of flour and water each time for getting the low-pitched sound.

The playing technique varies from Tabla in many aspects nevertheless.  For instance while playing Pakhawaj, the player hits the bass face with his whole palm where as a Tabla player will only use finger tips. In the treble side, the performer hits his whole palm with the fingers that are appropriately placed on the skin to produce different bols. The Pakhavaj also resembles Mridangam; however, it is smaller in diameter and has a lighter timbre.
