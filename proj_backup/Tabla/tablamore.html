<p>The tabla has an interesting construction.  The dayan (right hand drum)
           is almost always made of wood. The diameter at the membrane may run 
           from just under five inches to over six inches. The bayan (left hand drum)
           may be made of iron, aluminium, copper, steel, or clay; yet brass with a
           nickel or chrome plate is the most common material. Undoubtedly the most
           striking characteristic of the tabla is the large black spot on each of 
           the playing surfaces. These black spots are a mixture of gum, soot,
           and iron filings. Their function is to create the bell-like timbre that
           is characteristic of the instrument.</p>
        <p>Although the origin of tabla is somewhat obscure, it is generally 
           believed that it evolved from the barrel shaped drum called pakhawaj. 
           This was about three hundred years ago.</p>
