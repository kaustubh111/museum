		<p>Flutes are the earliest extant musical instruments. A number of flutes
		dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian
		Alb region of Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical 
		tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.
		Flutes, including the famous Bansuri, have been an integral part of Indian 
		classical music since 1500 BC. A major deity of Hinduism, Krishna, 
		has been associated with the flute.</p>
		
		</p>A flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the
		instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The air stream across this
		hole creates a Bernoulli, or siphon. This excites the air contained in the 
		usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The player changes the
		pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the 
		instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its 
		corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flute player
		can also change the pitch of a note by causing the air in the flute to resonate
		at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.[</p>
